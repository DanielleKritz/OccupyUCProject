# OccupyUCProject
Real-time room occupancy status system designed by Carmen, Danielle, and Jake.

The idea behind OccuyUC is to create a way for students to know in real-time which study rooms are occupied and which are available. Often students spend time walking through a full building to find a free spot to study just to realize there are no rooms and that all their time looking was wasted.
